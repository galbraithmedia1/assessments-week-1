// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/



// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "During this software development lifecycle phase, the specialists meticulously collect precise requirements from the customer to present a solution fine-tuned to their needs. Any unclarities must be elucidated in this stage only."

const design = "The third phase entails two further steps. High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD). The result of the former is the future architecture of a software product, whereas the LLD step describes how each and every feature in the product should work. Its also in this phase when the database specification is developed to decide on data management and storage for future processing, retrieval, or evaluation."

const implementation = " engineers start creating the entire system by crafting code using the required technology. During this software development lifecycle phase, clients will be able to have a first look at your future product. And by the end of the building process, clients will have an operating feature to share with the customers. "

const testingAndIntegration = "In the fifth stage, all the pieces of code are tested to verify and validate a software product. Testers then perform Software Testing Life Cycle activities to monitor the system for bugs, and defects. This is done to check the correspondence between the real and expected behavior of a program."

const maintain= " Once the system is deployed, any necessary upgrades, enhancements, and changes can be made, implementing new features into the operating software. It is crucial to maintain and modernize the system regularly so it can adapt to future needs."
